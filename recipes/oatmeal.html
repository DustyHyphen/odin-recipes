    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The humble oatmeal is a versatile meal that can be done quickly and eaten at any time. Breakfast? No problem. Lunch? It might be weird, but go for it! Dinner? You can totally do it.</p>
      <p>In this version, fruits and some seeds will be used, making it a nutritional bomb.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>You can get really creative, but this is what I usually use for mine:</p>

      <ul>
       <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
       <li>1 spoon chia seeds</li>
       <li>1 spoon flax seeds</li>
       <li>1/2 spoon pumpkin seeds</li>
       <li>raisins</li>
       <li>1 banana</li>
       <li>Any other fruits you want to add</li>
       <li>1 cup of water or plant milk</li>
       <li>cinnamon</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      
      <ol>
       <li>Add the oats, seeds, raisins, and cinnamon, to a small pot.</li>
       <li>Add the water/plan milk to the pot. Stir and bring to a boil.</li>
       <li>Once it starts boiling, set the heat to low and continue cooking for 3-5 minutes.</li>
       <li>In the meantime, cut the banana in half. Slice one half and mash the other.</li>
       <li>Chop any other fruit that needs it (e.g. strawberries)</li>
       <li>When the oats are done, serve them in a bowl and mix with the mashed banana. You can add the rest of the fruits on top or mix them if you prefer (I certainly do it!).</li>
       


      </ol>
